# CoinInventory
A tool to keep inventory on coins.

The goal is to create an inventory system where the user can input the features of their coins and they will be stored in a list. Ideally that list will be written to another file so the values can be saved.

Bugs:
Only the most recent coin added will print to console when I do a printout of all objects in list.
